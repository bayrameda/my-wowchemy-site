I am a research scientist at [Accenture Labs, Dublin](https://www.accenture.com/ie-en/about/accenture-labs-index). I recently obtained my PhD at [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). [My doctoral thesis](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/290061) was on representation learning for multi-relational data where my thesis director was [Pierre Vandergheynst](https://people.epfl.ch/pierre.vandergheynst). I like to research machine learning for graph-structured data and I am broadly interested in knowledge representation and reasoning for explainable AI.

I also have a signal processing background, which I majored in MSc. [My master thesis](http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12620895/index.pdf) was on the analysis of airborne LiDAR point clouds using the graph signal processing framework. I completed it under the co-supervision of [Aydin Alatan](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/aydin-alatan) and [Elif Vural](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/elif-vural).
