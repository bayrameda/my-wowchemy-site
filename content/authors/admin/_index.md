I am a Machine Learning  researcher at [Accenture Labs, Dublin](https://www.accenture.com/ie-en/about/accenture-labs-index), where I explore novel ways of applying machine learning to graph-structured data. My research interests include knowledge representation and reasoning and explainable AI. I have a PhD in Computer Science from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), where I worked on [representation learning for multi-relational data](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/290061) under the supervision of [Pierre Vandergheynst](https://people.epfl.ch/pierre.vandergheynst).

Besides machine learning, I am also fascinated by understanding human cognitive processes such as memory, learning, problem-solving, abstraction, common-sense reasoning. To satiate my intellectual appetite and further enrich my exploration in Artificial Intelligence, I embarked on a journey into studying Cognitive Sciences at University College Dublin (UCD).

<!-- I also have a signal processing background, which I majored in MSc. [My master thesis](http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12620895/index.pdf) was on the analysis of airborne LiDAR point clouds using the graph signal processing framework. I completed it under the co-supervision of [Aydin Alatan](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/aydin-alatan) and [Elif Vural](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/elif-vural). -->
